## Hey ThereðŸ‘‹!
### I am Satvik

I am a 13 yrs old guy who loves to code!

I enjoy playing with computers and I aspire to be Tony Stark when I grow up. I know it's funny but a wise man once said "If people aren't laughing at your dreams, your dreams aren't big enough". I am a beginner for now but I hope I'll be mentoring others when I master python.

I like reading books, listening to music, playing football or any informative things in my freetime (yes I don't play video games but I want to ðŸ˜‚)
