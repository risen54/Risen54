### Hey there!

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Risen54&label=PROFILE+VIEWS)

I am a 13 yrs old guy who loves to code!

I enjoy playing with computers and I aspire to be Tony Stark when I grow up. I know it's funny but a wise man once said **"If people aren't laughing at your dreams, your dreams aren't big enough"**. I am an intermediate for now but I hope I'll be mentoring others when I master python.

I like reading books, listening to music, playing football, Maths & physics (yes xD), changing my text editors (lol)
